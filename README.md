## 🎓 Math-in-Step
**Math-In-Step** is a fully portable, browser-based symbolic math solver that runs entirely from a single HTML file — no installation, no backend, but yes, still require internet connection to download Pyscript (python-in-browser) and other libraries.
Built with PyScript, SymPy, and Lark, **Math-In-Step** provides a simple ecosystem to provide scaffolded, step-by-step math solving experience. It doesn’t just check answers — it understands the structure and reasoning behind them.

## ✨ Key Features

🧮 Runs from a single HTML file — just open it in your browser, anywhere, anytime

🪜 Step-by-step scaffolding — guides learners through structured reasoning

🧩 Matrix-aware comparison — compares symbolic structures, not just values

💡 Intelligent error feedback — detects missing operators, commas, or brackets and explains them clearly

⚙️ Pure client-side PyScript — no external server or database required

🧠 SymPy-powered symbolic understanding — precise, reliable, and fast

## 🧱 Why Math-In-Step

Unlike traditional math solvers that only provide final answers, **Math-In-Step** focuses on learning through steps.
It interprets student answers structurally, gives meaningful feedback for error in math expression, and helps users build understanding one step at a time — all from a single, portable HTML file.

Ideal for:
Educators distributing math activities without worrying about installations or worrying about compatible devices

Students practicing symbolic algebra, including matrix operations, in any modern browser

Developers experimenting with PyScript-based symbolic reasoning tools

## 🚀 Try It

Use **createproblem.html** to start creating math problem

Use **analytics.html** to start analyzing student submissions

Run it in Windows, in MacOS, in Linux, in Android, in iOS and in any operating system that supports modern browser

Start solving — no setup required!

## 🎯 Project Origin & Acknowledgement

This **Math-In=Step** project is an outcome of **Pengabdian Kepada Masyarakat** (Community Service Activities) conducted by the Computer Science Faculty of **Universitas Mercu Buana (UMB), Jakarta**, in collaboration with **Dinas Pendidikan Provinsi DKI Jakarta c.q. Suku Dinas Pendidikan Wilayah II Jakarta Barat**  

As part of UMB's commitment to community and educational outreach, this tool was developed to support mathematics learning in schools and communities.

We gratefully acknowledge the support from UMB and all participating faculty, staff, and students.
